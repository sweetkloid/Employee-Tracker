# Employee-Tracker
challenge 12
## Description

We wanted to build a place where employeers had the ability to view their departments, roles, and employess form their database. We wanted them to be able to access the database and view the information they are looking for in a table that shows all the information they would need. We wanted them to have the ability to add and delete departments, roles, or employess as needed. All this is done through terminal propmts using inquirer. We used the inquirer to access mysql that wholes the users information to display and edit it. We also used console.table to dispaly the users information in the terminal when prompted.
